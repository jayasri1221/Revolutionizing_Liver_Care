# ðŸ§  Revolutionizing Liver Care: Predicting Liver Cirrhosis using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques

This project is focused on leveraging **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to develop a predictive model for **early detection and prognosis of liver cirrhosis**, a progressive liver disease characterized by irreversible scarring of liver tissue.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

Liver cirrhosis, if left undiagnosed or untreated, can lead to serious complications and even liver failure. Early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project builds a predictive model using various machine learning algorithms and integrates it into a Flask-based web application for real-time usage.

By accurately identifying individuals at risk, the model enables timely intervention and personalized treatment strategies, contributing to better healthcare efficiency and quality.
